        <p>This is a screenshot of a visual effect from Super Mario Odyssey, where the flagpole is in the middle of fading out. The game uses this fade out animation when it loads/unloads objects in the distance, or when an object gets to close to the camera and is removed, as in this case. It's a little difficult to make out the specifics of the effect due to this screenshot being from a compressed youtube video and you'd really need to go through it frame by frame to see it in it's entirety, but it appears to be a screen-space checkerboard-like effect that decreases the size of the visible squares until the object is gone. It could be created by rendering the object as normal, but then editing the final result based on the pixel's position on the screen. It's a screen-space effect because the pattern doesn't change based on camera angle. It's also not effected by lighting or anything else in the world.</p>
        <p>I experiment with using gl_FragCoords to do something similar in part A of this assignment, where a checkerboard of squares had it's color inverted. By going something slightly more complicated, I could instead change the effect to be a grid of squares, and then remove the color from everything outside that grid. Then I'd just need to animate the squares getting smaller over time.</p>
        <p>The effect also appears to make the still visible parts slightly transparent, so I'd have to add that in too.</p>
        <p>The effect caught my eye while playing because it's so different than basically every other pop-in transition I've seen before.</p>
